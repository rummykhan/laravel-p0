# Tailwind CSS Build Fix Summary

## Issue
The CodeBuild pipeline was failing with the error:
```
Error: Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/postcss'
```

## Root Cause
The Next.js application was using Tailwind CSS v4 with the new PostCSS plugin architecture, but the required dependencies were placed in `devDependencies`. During the CodeBuild process, when `npm ci` runs, it may skip dev dependencies in production environments, causing the Tailwind PostCSS plugin to be unavailable during the build process.

## Solution
Moved the Tailwind CSS dependencies from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in `nextjs-users/package.json`:

- `@tailwindcss/postcss`: ^4
- `tailwindcss`: ^4

## Files Modified
- `nextjs-users/package.json` - Moved Tailwind dependencies to production dependencies
- `laravel-p0/docs/troubleshooting-build-issues.md` - Added troubleshooting section for this issue

## Verification
- ✅ Local build test passed: `npm run build` completes successfully
- ✅ Dependencies install correctly with `npm ci`
- ✅ Tailwind CSS v4 configuration is properly recognized

## Next Steps
The pipeline should now build successfully. The Next.js application will have access to all required Tailwind CSS dependencies during the CodeBuild process.

## Configuration Details
The application uses:
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with the new `@import "tailwindcss"` syntax
- **PostCSS plugin**: `@tailwindcss/postcss` for processing
- **Next.js 15.3.4** with standalone output for Docker deployment
- **Custom theme configuration** with CSS variables for light/dark mode

This fix ensures that all CSS processing dependencies are available during the production build process in AWS CodeBuild.
