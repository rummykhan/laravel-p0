# Build Fix Summary - TypeScript Not Found Issue

## Problem
The AWS CodeBuild pipeline was failing with the error:
```
sh: 1: tsc: not found
Command did not exit successfully npm run build exit status 127
```

## Root Cause
TypeScript was listed in `devDependencies` but CodeBuild environments may skip dev dependencies in certain configurations, making the TypeScript compiler unavailable for the build process.

## Final Solution
**Moved TypeScript from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`** in `package.json`:

### Before:
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "typescript": "~5.6.3"
},
"dependencies": {
  "aws-cdk-lib": "2.196.0",
  "constructs": "^10.0.0"
}
```

### After:
```json
"devDependencies": {
  // TypeScript removed from here
},
"dependencies": {
  "aws-cdk-lib": "2.196.0",
  "constructs": "^10.0.0",
  "typescript": "~5.6.3"  // TypeScript moved here
}
```

## Why This Works
1. **Production dependencies are always installed**: `npm ci` always installs dependencies listed in the `dependencies` section
2. **Build tools need to be available**: For CDK projects, TypeScript is essential for compilation and should be treated as a runtime requirement
3. **Consistent across environments**: This ensures TypeScript is available in both local development and CI/CD environments

## Alternative Solutions Considered
1. **Environment variable fixes**: Tried removing `NODE_ENV=production` but this didn't solve the core issue
2. **Explicit installation**: Tried adding fallback installation commands but this added complexity
3. **Runtime specification**: Tried specifying CodeBuild runtime but the dependency issue remained

## Verification
- ✅ Local build works: `npm run build`
- ✅ CDK synthesis works: `npx cdk synth`
- ✅ All tests pass: `./scripts/test-deployment.sh`
- ✅ Clean install works: `rm -rf node_modules && npm ci && npm run build`

## Best Practices Learned
1. **Consider build requirements carefully**: Build tools that are essential for the application should be in `dependencies`
2. **Test with production-like environments**: Always test with `npm ci` to simulate CI/CD environments
3. **Keep it simple**: Simple solutions are often more reliable than complex workarounds

## Impact
- **Build time**: No significant impact on build time
- **Bundle size**: TypeScript is a build-time dependency and doesn't affect runtime bundle size
- **Maintenance**: Simpler pipeline configuration, easier to maintain

This fix ensures reliable builds across all environments and eliminates the TypeScript availability issue permanently.
