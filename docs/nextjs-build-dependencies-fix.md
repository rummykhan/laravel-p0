# Next.js Build Dependencies Fix Summary

## Issues
The CodeBuild pipeline was failing with multiple dependency-related errors:

1. **Tailwind CSS Error:**
```
Error: Cannot find module '@tailwindcss/postcss'
```

2. **TypeScript Error:**
```
It looks like you're trying to use TypeScript but do not have the required package(s) installed.
Please install typescript, @types/react, and @types/node
```

## Root Cause
The Next.js application had build-time dependencies in `devDependencies` instead of `dependencies`. During the CodeBuild process, when `npm ci` runs in production mode, it may skip dev dependencies, causing essential build tools to be unavailable.

## Solution
Moved all build-time dependencies from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in `nextjs-users/package.json`:

**Tailwind CSS Dependencies:**
- `@tailwindcss/postcss`: ^4
- `tailwindcss`: ^4

**TypeScript Dependencies:**
- `typescript`: ^5
- `@types/node`: ^20
- `@types/react`: ^19
- `@types/react-dom`: ^19

## Files Modified
- `nextjs-users/package.json` - Moved all build-time dependencies to production dependencies
- `laravel-p0/docs/troubleshooting-build-issues.md` - Added troubleshooting sections for both issues

## Final Package.json Structure
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^19.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^19.0.0",
    "next": "15.3.4",
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4",
    "tailwindcss": "^4",
    "typescript": "^5",
    "@types/node": "^20",
    "@types/react": "^19",
    "@types/react-dom": "^19"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
  }
}
```

## Verification
- ✅ Local build test passed: `npm run build` completes successfully
- ✅ Dependencies install correctly with `npm install` and `npm ci`
- ✅ TypeScript compilation works properly
- ✅ Tailwind CSS v4 configuration is properly recognized

## Next Steps
The pipeline should now build successfully. The Next.js application will have access to all required Tailwind CSS dependencies during the CodeBuild process.

## Configuration Details
The application uses:
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with the new `@import "tailwindcss"` syntax
- **PostCSS plugin**: `@tailwindcss/postcss` for processing
- **Next.js 15.3.4** with standalone output for Docker deployment
- **Custom theme configuration** with CSS variables for light/dark mode

This fix ensures that all CSS processing dependencies are available during the production build process in AWS CodeBuild.
